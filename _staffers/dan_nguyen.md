Howdy! I am a junior double majoring in CS and DS! I'm a cadet in the US Army Reserved Officer Training Corps, and so I'll spend a lot of my time at Equinox trying to hit a PR. I love anything related to batman, I always think about the Roman Empire, and I'm super duper excited to be a TA for this course again!
