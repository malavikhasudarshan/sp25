## Introduction

The graduate project is **offered only to students enrolled in Data C200, CS C200A, or Data 200S**. Other students are welcome to explore the questions and datasets in the project for personal learning, but their work will not be graded or counted towards their final grades.

The purpose of the project is to give students experience in both open-ended data science analysis and research in general.

This page will be updated with more information about the grad project later on.
